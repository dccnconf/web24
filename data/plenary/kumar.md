---
Quantum Blockchain is the intersection of quantum computing and blockchain technology, exploring both the challenges posed by quantum computing to existing blockchain systems and the opportunities for innovation in creating more secure and efficient decentralized networks. However, various challenges such as secure communication, scalability, fast processing, key distribution etc. need to be addressed by designing new innovative solutions. Quantum computing could potentially enable more efficient consensus mechanisms in blockchain networks, leading to faster transaction confirmations and scalability improvements. It also offers new cryptographic techniques, such as quantum key distribution (QKD), which could enhance the security and privacy of blockchain transactions. Moreover, Qubit design is challenging keeping in view of the overall performance evaluation of any system.

Hence, in this talk, we will explore various possibilities of application of Quantum blockchain for wide range of applications scenarios for future.
