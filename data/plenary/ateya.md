title: "Emerging Security Solutions for the Internet of Things Networks"
---
The rapid evolution of Internet of Things (IoT) networks has completely transformed multiple industries, including healthcare, smart cities, industrial automation, and home automation. 
However, this growth has been associated with significant security challenges, requiring strong and innovative measures to protect these networked devices. 
The talk will examine the latest security solutions for IoT networks, specifically focusing on trust management methods. 
These mechanisms play a critical part in ensuring the security and reliability of data and communications. 
Trust management for the IoT involves assessing the reliability and security of devices and their interactions, reducing the potential risks posed by malevolent actors and hacked equipment. 
Some new solutions being developed include trust frameworks based on blockchain technology, algorithms that use machine learning to detect anomalies, and models for evaluating decentralized trust. 
These approaches seek to improve security by offering scalable, adaptable, and resilient strategies to secure IoT networks from various attacks. 
The talk will investigate the difficulties in implementing and researching the future of IoT, emphasizing the importance of established protocols to create thorough security methods for the changing IoT environment.
